# electron-cinematizer-poc

This is a proof-of-concept app to demonstrate an electron app featuring a control window interacting/affecting a renderer window.

## Building and Development

This is a pretty straightforward/typical `nodejs` project. Install deps, run `build`, then run `start`:

```bash
npm install
npm run build # run `prod` instead for optimized (i.e., no `eval`)/minified code
rpm run start
```
